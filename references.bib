  abstract = { Sales, product design, and engineering teams benefit immensely from better understanding customer perspectives. How do customers combine a product's technical specifications (i.e., engineered attributes) to form abstract product benefits (i.e., meta-attributes)? To address this question, the authors use machine learning and natural language processing to develop a methodological framework that extracts a hierarchy of product attributes based on contextual information of how attributes are expressed in consumer reviews. The attribute hierarchy reveals linkages between engineered attributes and meta-attributes within a product category, enabling flexible sentiment analysis that can identify how consumers receive meta-attributes, and which engineered attributes are main drivers. The framework can guide managers to monitor only portions of review content that are relevant to specific attributes of interest. Moreover, managers can compare products within and between brands, where different names and attribute combinations are often associated with similar benefits. The authors apply the framework to the tablet computer category to generate dashboards and perceptual maps and provide validations of the attribute hierarchy using both primary and secondary data. Resultant insights allow the exploration of substantive questions, such as how Apple improved successive generations of iPads and why Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba discontinued their tablet product lines. }

    abstract = { Massive online text reviews can be a powerful market research tool for understanding consumer experiences and helping firms improve and innovate. This research exploits the rich semantic properties of text reviews and proposes a novel machine learning modeling framework that can reliably and efficiently extract consumer opinions and uncover potential interaction effects across these opinions, thereby identifying hidden and nuanced areas for product and service improvement beyond existing modeling approaches in this domain. In particular, we develop an opinion extraction and effect estimation framework that allows for uncovering customer opinions’ average effects and their interaction effects. Interactions among opinions can be synergistic when the co-occurrence of two opinions yields an effect greater than the sum of two parts, or as what we call dysergistic, when the co-occurrence of two opinions results in dampened effect. We apply the model in the context of large-scale customer ratings and text reviews for hotels and demonstrate our framework’s ability to screen synergy and dysergy effects among opinions. Our model also flexibly and efficiently accommodates a large number of opinions, which provides insights into rare yet potentially important opinions. The model can guide managers to prioritize joint areas of product and service improvement and innovation by uncovering the most prominent synergistic pairs. Model comparison with extant machine learning approaches demonstrates our improved predictive ability and managerial insights.This paper was accepted by Gui Liberali, marketing. }

abstract = {The amount of digital text-based consumer review data has increased dramatically and there exist many machine learning approaches for automated text-based sentiment analysis. Marketing researchers have employed various methods for analyzing text reviews but lack a comprehensive comparison of their performance to guide method selection in future applications. We focus on the fundamental relationship between a consumer’s overall empirical evaluation, and the text-based explanation of their evaluation. We study the empirical tradeoff between predictive and diagnostic abilities, in applying various methods to estimate this fundamental relationship. We incorporate methods previously employed in the marketing literature, and methods that are so far less common in the marketing literature. For generalizability, we analyze 25,241 products in nine product categories, and 260,489 reviews across five review platforms. We find that neural network-based machine learning methods, in particular pre-trained versions, offer the most accurate predictions, while topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation offer deeper diagnostics. However, neural network models are not suited for diagnostic purposes and topic models are ill equipped for making predictions. Consequently, future selection of methods to process text reviews is likely to be based on analysts’ goals of prediction versus diagnostics.}

abstract = {Mobile application (app) reviews contain valuable information for app developers. A plethora of supervised and unsupervised techniques have been proposed in the literature to synthesize useful user feedback from app reviews. However, traditional supervised classification algorithms require extensive manual effort to label ground truth data, while unsupervised text mining techniques, such as topic models, often produce suboptimal results due to the sparsity of useful information in the reviews. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a fully automatic and unsupervised approach for extracting useful information from mobile app reviews. The proposed approach is based on keyATM, a keyword-assisted approach for generating topic models. keyATM overcomes the problem of data sparsity by using seeding keywords extracted directly from the review corpus. These keywords are then used to generate meaningful domain-specific topics. Our approach is evaluated over two datasets of mobile app reviews sampled from the domains of Investing and Food Delivery apps. The results show that our approach produces significantly more coherent topics than traditional topic modeling techniques.},

abstract = {Topic models have great potential for helping users understand document corpora. This potential is stymied by their purely unsupervised nature, which often leads to topics that are neither entirely meaningful nor effective in extrinsic tasks (Chang et al., 2009). We propose a simple and effective way to guide topic models to learn topics of specific interest to a user. We achieve this by providing sets of seed words that a user believes are representative of the underlying topics in a corpus. Our model uses these seeds to improve both topic-word distributions (by biasing topics to produce appropriate seed words) and to improve document-topic distributions (by biasing documents to select topics related to the seed words they contain). Extrinsic evaluation on a document clustering task reveals a significant improvement when using seed information, even over other models that use seed information na\"{\i}vely.},

abstract = {The growth of the Internet has led to massive availability of online consumer reviews. So far, papers studying online reviews have mainly analysed how non-textual features, such as ratings and volume, influence different types of consumer behavior, such as information adoption decisions or product choices. However, little attention has been paid to examining the textual aspects of online reviews in order to study brand image and brand positioning. The text analysis of online reviews inevitably raises the concept of “text mining”; that is, the process of extracting useful and meaningful information from unstructured text. This research proposes an unified, structured and easy-to-implement procedure for the text analysis of online reviews with the ultimate goal of studying brand image and brand positioning. The text mining analysis is based on a lexicon-based approach, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (Pennebaker et al., 2007), which provides the researcher with insights into emotional and psychological brand associations.}

abstract = {In the digital age, customers use online reviews to minimize the risks associated with purchasing a product. Major online retailers help customers choose the right product by exposing reviews that received many “helpful” votes at the top of the review section. Given that reviews that have received the maximum helpfulness votes are considered more important in purchase decisions, understanding determinants of helpfulness votes offers clear benefits to online retailers and review platforms. This study focuses on the effect of review informativeness, which is measured by the number of attributes discussed in a review, and its interplay of review valence on customers' perception of review helpfulness. We applied a word-level bigram analysis to derive product attributes from review text and examined the influence of the number of attributes on the review's helpfulness votes. More importantly, we also suggested the moderating role of review valence. Estimation results of the Zero-inflated Poisson models on 21,125 reviews across 14 wireless earbuds indicated that as more attributes are discussed in a review, the more the review can earn helpfulness votes from customers. Furthermore, the positive association between the number of attributes and helpfulness was enhanced among negative reviews. This study contributes to customers' information processing literature and offers guidelines to online retailers in designing a better decision support system.}

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effect of CGEI—both quantitative (i.e., star rating, star rating volume) and qualitative (i.e., customer review content) aspects—on actual sales in an online platform-based market. We analyze the regression of quantitative GCEI on sales and for qualitative GCEI we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. We discover that star ratings do not always lead to increased sales, implying that star ratings and sales have an inverted U-shaped relationship. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that star rating volume has a positive effect on sales. We reveal that the review contents of product quality and added value have a positive effect on sales, whereas those of seller service have no effect on sales. This study provides some insight into how customer-generated information can increase actual sales in online platform-based markets.}

ABSTRACT={This study investigated the impact of online product reviews on consumers purchasing decisions by using eye-tracking. The research methodology involved (i) development of a conceptual framework of online product review and purchasing intention through the moderation role of gender and visual attention in comments, and (ii) empirical investigation into the region of interest (ROI) analysis of consumers fixation during the purchase decision process and behavioral analysis. The results showed that consumers’ attention to negative comments was significantly greater than that to positive comments, especially for female consumers. Furthermore, the study identified a significant correlation between the visual browsing behavior of consumers and their purchase intention. It also found that consumers were not able to identify false comments. The current study provides a deep understanding of the underlying mechanism of how online reviews influence shopping behavior, reveals the effect of gender on this effect for the first time and explains it from the perspective of attentional bias, which is essential for the theory of online consumer behavior. Specifically, the different effects of consumers’ attention to negative comments seem to be moderated through gender with female consumers’ attention to negative comments being significantly greater than to positive ones. These findings suggest that practitioners need to pay particular attention to negative comments and resolve them promptly through the customization of product/service information, taking into consideration consumer characteristics, including gender.}

ABSTRACT = {Sustainability is a major contemporary issue that affects everyone. Many companies now produce an annual sustainability report, mainly intended for their stakeholders and the public, enumerating their goals and degrees of achievement regarding sustainable development. Although sustainability reports are an important resource to understand a company&rsquo;s sustainability strategies and practices, the difficulty of extracting key information from dozens or hundreds of pages with sustainability and business jargon has highlighted the need for metrics to effectively measure the content of such reports. Accordingly, many researchers have attempted to analyze the concepts and messages from sustainability reports using various natural language processing (NLP) methods. In this study, we propose a novel approach that overcomes the shortcomings of previous studies. Using the sentence similarity method and sentiment analysis, the study clearly shows thematic practices and trends, as well as a significant difference in the balance of positive and negative information in the reports across companies. The results of sentiment analysis prove that the new approach of this study is very useful. It confirms that companies actively use the sustainability report to improve their positive image when they experience a crisis. It confirms that companies actively use the sustainability report to improve their positive image when they experience a crisis. The inferences gained from this method will not only help companies produce better reports that can be utilized effectively, but also provide researchers with ideas for further research. In the concluding section, we summarize the implications of our approach and discuss limitations and future research areas.},

We propose to use local cost functions whose simultaneous or sequential (one by one) minimization leads to a very simple ALS algorithm which works under some sparsity constraints both for an under-determined (a system which has less sensors than sources) and over-determined model. The extensive experimental results confirm the validity and high performance of the developed algorithms, especially with usage of the multi-layer hierarchical NMF. Extension of the proposed algorithm to multidimensional Sparse Component Analysis and Smooth Component Analysis is also proposed.",

To solve this problem, we created a set of techniques that utilize a semisupervised model that allows researchers to classify documents into predefined categories efficiently. We propose a dictionary making procedure to avoid inclusion of words that are likely to confuse the model and deteriorate the its classification performance classification accuracy using a new entropy-based diagnostic tool. In our experiments, we classify sentences of the United Nations General Assembly speeches into six predefined categories using the seeded Latent Dirichlet allocation and Newsmap, which were trained with a small “seed word dictionary” that we created following the procedure. The result shows that, while keyword dictionary can only classify 25\% of sentences, Newsmap can classify over 60\% of them accurately correctly and; its accuracy exceeds 70\% when contextual information is taken into consideration by kernel smoothing of topic likelihoods. We argue that once seed word dictionaries are created by the international relations community, semisupervised models would become more useful than unsupervised models for theory-driven text analysis. }

abstract = {Personalized recommendation systems have solved the information overload problem caused by large volumes of Web data effectively. However, most existing recommendation algorithms are weak in handling the problem of rating data sparsity that characterizes most recommender systems and results in deteriorated recommendation accuracy. The results in the KDDCUP and Netflix competition have proven that the matrix factorization algorithm achieves better performance than other recommendation algorithms when the rating data is scarce. However, the highly sparse rating matrix will cause the overfitting problem in matrix factorization. Although regularization can relieve the issue of overfitting to some extent, it is still a significant challenge to train an effective model for recommender systems when the data is highly sparse. Therefore, this paper proposes a co-SVD model to enrich the single data source and mitigate the overfitting problem in matrix factorization. The user preferences are enriched not only by rating data but also the tag data; subsequently, the relevance between tags and item features are explored. Furthermore, according to the assumption that user preferences will change with time, we optimize the preference and relevance by adding the temporal influence. Based on the MovieLens benchmark datasets, the experimental results indicate that the proposed co-SVD method is more effective than other baselines. Matrix co-factorization provides an effective method to the solve data sparsity problem with additional information. The method can be used to address this problem in various expert and intelligent systems such as recommendation advertisements, e-commerce sites, and social media platforms, all of which require a relatively large amount of input data from users.}

abstract = {Most recommender systems focus on the areas of leisure activities. As the Web evolves into omnipresent utility, recommender systems penetrate more serious applications such as those in online scientific communities. In this paper, we investigate the task of recommendation in online scientific communities which exhibit two characteristics: 1) there exists very rich information about users and items; 2) The users in the scientific communities tend not to give explicit ratings to the resources, even though they have clear preference in their minds. To address the above two characteristics, we propose matrix factorization techniques to incorporate rich user and item information into recommendation with implicit feedback. Specifically, the user information matrix is decomposed into a shared subspace with the implicit feedback matrix, and so does the item information matrix. In other words, the subspaces between multiple related matrices are jointly learned by sharing information between the matrices. The experiments on the testbed from an online scientific community (i.e., Nanohub) show that the proposed method can effectively improve the recommendation performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Student grade prediction (SGP) is an important educational problem for designing personalized strategies of teaching and learning. Many studies adopt the technique of matrix factorization (MF). However, their methods often focus on the grade records regardless of the side information, such as backgrounds and relationships. To this end, in this paper, we propose a new MF method, called graph regularized robust matrix factorization (GRMF), based on the recent robust MF version. GRMF integrates two side graphs built on the side data of students and courses into the objective of robust low-rank MF. As a result, the learned features of students and courses can grasp more priors from educational situations to achieve higher grade prediction results. The resulting objective problem can be effectively optimized by the Majorization Minimization (MM) algorithm. In addition, GRMF not only can yield the specific features for the education domain but can also deal with the case of missing, noisy, and corruptive data. To verify our method, we test GRMF on two public data sets for rating prediction and image recovery. Finally, we apply GRMF to educational data from our university, which is composed of 1325 students and 832 courses. The extensive experimental results manifestly show that GRMF is robust to various data problem and achieves more effective features in comparison with other methods. Moreover, GRMF also delivers higher prediction accuracy than other methods on our educational data set. This technique can facilitate personalized teaching and learning in higher education.},

However, the absence of an interpretation method for the sentence similarity makes it difficult to explain the model output. In this work, we explicitly describe the sentence distance as the weighted sum of contextualized token distances on the basis of a transportation problem, and then present the optimal transport-based distance measure, named RCMD; it identifies and leverages semantically-aligned token pairs. In the end, we propose CLRCMD, a contrastive learning framework that optimizes RCMD of sentence pairs, which enhances the quality of sentence similarity and their interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our learning framework outperforms other baselines on both STS and interpretable-STS benchmarks, indicating that it computes effective sentence similarity and also provides interpretation consistent with human judgement.",
