  abstract = { Sales, product design, and engineering teams benefit immensely from better understanding customer perspectives. How do customers combine a product's technical specifications (i.e., engineered attributes) to form abstract product benefits (i.e., meta-attributes)? To address this question, the authors use machine learning and natural language processing to develop a methodological framework that extracts a hierarchy of product attributes based on contextual information of how attributes are expressed in consumer reviews. The attribute hierarchy reveals linkages between engineered attributes and meta-attributes within a product category, enabling flexible sentiment analysis that can identify how consumers receive meta-attributes, and which engineered attributes are main drivers. The framework can guide managers to monitor only portions of review content that are relevant to specific attributes of interest. Moreover, managers can compare products within and between brands, where different names and attribute combinations are often associated with similar benefits. The authors apply the framework to the tablet computer category to generate dashboards and perceptual maps and provide validations of the attribute hierarchy using both primary and secondary data. Resultant insights allow the exploration of substantive questions, such as how Apple improved successive generations of iPads and why Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba discontinued their tablet product lines. }

    abstract = { Massive online text reviews can be a powerful market research tool for understanding consumer experiences and helping firms improve and innovate. This research exploits the rich semantic properties of text reviews and proposes a novel machine learning modeling framework that can reliably and efficiently extract consumer opinions and uncover potential interaction effects across these opinions, thereby identifying hidden and nuanced areas for product and service improvement beyond existing modeling approaches in this domain. In particular, we develop an opinion extraction and effect estimation framework that allows for uncovering customer opinions’ average effects and their interaction effects. Interactions among opinions can be synergistic when the co-occurrence of two opinions yields an effect greater than the sum of two parts, or as what we call dysergistic, when the co-occurrence of two opinions results in dampened effect. We apply the model in the context of large-scale customer ratings and text reviews for hotels and demonstrate our framework’s ability to screen synergy and dysergy effects among opinions. Our model also flexibly and efficiently accommodates a large number of opinions, which provides insights into rare yet potentially important opinions. The model can guide managers to prioritize joint areas of product and service improvement and innovation by uncovering the most prominent synergistic pairs. Model comparison with extant machine learning approaches demonstrates our improved predictive ability and managerial insights.This paper was accepted by Gui Liberali, marketing. }

abstract = {The amount of digital text-based consumer review data has increased dramatically and there exist many machine learning approaches for automated text-based sentiment analysis. Marketing researchers have employed various methods for analyzing text reviews but lack a comprehensive comparison of their performance to guide method selection in future applications. We focus on the fundamental relationship between a consumer’s overall empirical evaluation, and the text-based explanation of their evaluation. We study the empirical tradeoff between predictive and diagnostic abilities, in applying various methods to estimate this fundamental relationship. We incorporate methods previously employed in the marketing literature, and methods that are so far less common in the marketing literature. For generalizability, we analyze 25,241 products in nine product categories, and 260,489 reviews across five review platforms. We find that neural network-based machine learning methods, in particular pre-trained versions, offer the most accurate predictions, while topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation offer deeper diagnostics. However, neural network models are not suited for diagnostic purposes and topic models are ill equipped for making predictions. Consequently, future selection of methods to process text reviews is likely to be based on analysts’ goals of prediction versus diagnostics.}

A plethora of supervised and unsupervised techniques have been proposed in the literature to synthesize useful user feedback from app reviews. However, traditional supervised classification algorithms require extensive manual effort to label ground truth data, while unsupervised text mining techniques, such as topic models, often produce suboptimal results due to the sparsity of useful information in the reviews. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a fully automatic and unsupervised approach for extracting useful information from mobile app reviews. The proposed approach is based on keyATM, a keyword-assisted approach for generating topic models. keyATM overcomes the problem of data sparsity by using seeding keywords extracted directly from the review corpus. These keywords are then used to generate meaningful domain-specific topics. Our approach is evaluated over two datasets of mobile app reviews sampled from the domains of Investing and Food Delivery apps. The results show that our approach produces significantly more coherent topics than traditional topic modeling techniques.},

This potential is stymied by their purely unsupervised nature, which often leads to topics that are neither entirely meaningful nor effective in extrinsic tasks (Chang et al., 2009). We propose a simple and effective way to guide topic models to learn topics of specific interest to a user. We achieve this by providing sets of seed words that a user believes are representative of the underlying topics in a corpus. Our model uses these seeds to improve both topic-word distributions (by biasing topics to produce appropriate seed words) and to improve document-topic distributions (by biasing documents to select topics related to the seed words they contain). Extrinsic evaluation on a document clustering task reveals a significant improvement when using seed information, even over other models that use seed information na\"{\i}vely.},

abstract = {The growth of the Internet has led to massive availability of online consumer reviews. So far, papers studying online reviews have mainly analysed how non-textual features, such as ratings and volume, influence different types of consumer behavior, such as information adoption decisions or product choices. However, little attention has been paid to examining the textual aspects of online reviews in order to study brand image and brand positioning. The text analysis of online reviews inevitably raises the concept of “text mining”; that is, the process of extracting useful and meaningful information from unstructured text. This research proposes an unified, structured and easy-to-implement procedure for the text analysis of online reviews with the ultimate goal of studying brand image and brand positioning. The text mining analysis is based on a lexicon-based approach, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (Pennebaker et al., 2007), which provides the researcher with insights into emotional and psychological brand associations.}

Major online retailers help customers choose the right product by exposing reviews that received many “helpful” votes at the top of the review section. Given that reviews that have received the maximum helpfulness votes are considered more important in purchase decisions, understanding determinants of helpfulness votes offers clear benefits to online retailers and review platforms. This study focuses on the effect of review informativeness, which is measured by the number of attributes discussed in a review, and its interplay of review valence on customers' perception of review helpfulness. We applied a word-level bigram analysis to derive product attributes from review text and examined the influence of the number of attributes on the review's helpfulness votes. More importantly, we also suggested the moderating role of review valence. Estimation results of the Zero-inflated Poisson models on 21,125 reviews across 14 wireless earbuds indicated that as more attributes are discussed in a review, the more the review can earn helpfulness votes from customers. Furthermore, the positive association between the number of attributes and helpfulness was enhanced among negative reviews. This study contributes to customers' information processing literature and offers guidelines to online retailers in designing a better decision support system.}

We analyze the regression of quantitative GCEI on sales and for qualitative GCEI we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. We discover that star ratings do not always lead to increased sales, implying that star ratings and sales have an inverted U-shaped relationship. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that star rating volume has a positive effect on sales. We reveal that the review contents of product quality and added value have a positive effect on sales, whereas those of seller service have no effect on sales. This study provides some insight into how customer-generated information can increase actual sales in online platform-based markets.}

ABSTRACT={This study investigated the impact of online product reviews on consumers purchasing decisions by using eye-tracking. The research methodology involved (i) development of a conceptual framework of online product review and purchasing intention through the moderation role of gender and visual attention in comments, and (ii) empirical investigation into the region of interest (ROI) analysis of consumers fixation during the purchase decision process and behavioral analysis. The results showed that consumers’ attention to negative comments was significantly greater than that to positive comments, especially for female consumers. Furthermore, the study identified a significant correlation between the visual browsing behavior of consumers and their purchase intention. It also found that consumers were not able to identify false comments. The current study provides a deep understanding of the underlying mechanism of how online reviews influence shopping behavior, reveals the effect of gender on this effect for the first time and explains it from the perspective of attentional bias, which is essential for the theory of online consumer behavior. Specifically, the different effects of consumers’ attention to negative comments seem to be moderated through gender with female consumers’ attention to negative comments being significantly greater than to positive ones. These findings suggest that practitioners need to pay particular attention to negative comments and resolve them promptly through the customization of product/service information, taking into consideration consumer characteristics, including gender.}

ABSTRACT = {Sustainability is a major contemporary issue that affects everyone. Many companies now produce an annual sustainability report, mainly intended for their stakeholders and the public, enumerating their goals and degrees of achievement regarding sustainable development. Although sustainability reports are an important resource to understand a company&rsquo;s sustainability strategies and practices, the difficulty of extracting key information from dozens or hundreds of pages with sustainability and business jargon has highlighted the need for metrics to effectively measure the content of such reports. Accordingly, many researchers have attempted to analyze the concepts and messages from sustainability reports using various natural language processing (NLP) methods. In this study, we propose a novel approach that overcomes the shortcomings of previous studies. Using the sentence similarity method and sentiment analysis, the study clearly shows thematic practices and trends, as well as a significant difference in the balance of positive and negative information in the reports across companies. The results of sentiment analysis prove that the new approach of this study is very useful. It confirms that companies actively use the sustainability report to improve their positive image when they experience a crisis. It confirms that companies actively use the sustainability report to improve their positive image when they experience a crisis. The inferences gained from this method will not only help companies produce better reports that can be utilized effectively, but also provide researchers with ideas for further research. In the concluding section, we summarize the implications of our approach and discuss limitations and future research areas.},

We propose to use local cost functions whose simultaneous or sequential (one by one) minimization leads to a very simple ALS algorithm which works under some sparsity constraints both for an under-determined (a system which has less sensors than sources) and over-determined model. The extensive experimental results confirm the validity and high performance of the developed algorithms, especially with usage of the multi-layer hierarchical NMF. Extension of the proposed algorithm to multidimensional Sparse Component Analysis and Smooth Component Analysis is also proposed.",

abstract = {Abstract In recent years, fully automated content analysis based on probabilistic topic models has become popular among social scientists because of their scalability. However, researchers find that these models often fail to measure specific concepts of substantive interest by inadvertently creating multiple topics with similar content and combining distinct themes into a single topic. In this article, we empirically demonstrate that providing a small number of keywords can substantially enhance the measurement performance of topic models. An important advantage of the proposed keyword-assisted topic model (keyATM) is that the specification of keywords requires researchers to label topics prior to fitting a model to the data. This contrasts with a widespread practice of post hoc topic interpretation and adjustments that compromises the objectivity of empirical findings. In our application, we find that keyATM provides more interpretable results, has better document classification performance, and is less sensitive to the number of topics.}

    abstract = { There is a growing interest in quantitative analysis of large corpora among the international relations (IR) scholars, but many of them find it difficult to perform analysis consistently with existing theoretical frameworks using unsupervised machine learning models to further develop the field. To solve this problem, we created a set of techniques that utilize a semisupervised model that allows researchers to classify documents into predefined categories efficiently. We propose a dictionary making procedure to avoid inclusion of words that are likely to confuse the model and deteriorate the its classification performance classification accuracy using a new entropy-based diagnostic tool. In our experiments, we classify sentences of the United Nations General Assembly speeches into six predefined categories using the seeded Latent Dirichlet allocation and Newsmap, which were trained with a small “seed word dictionary” that we created following the procedure. The result shows that, while keyword dictionary can only classify 25\% of sentences, Newsmap can classify over 60\% of them accurately correctly and; its accuracy exceeds 70\% when contextual information is taken into consideration by kernel smoothing of topic likelihoods. We argue that once seed word dictionaries are created by the international relations community, semisupervised models would become more useful than unsupervised models for theory-driven text analysis. }

abstract = {Personalized recommendation systems have solved the information overload problem caused by large volumes of Web data effectively. However, most existing recommendation algorithms are weak in handling the problem of rating data sparsity that characterizes most recommender systems and results in deteriorated recommendation accuracy. The results in the KDDCUP and Netflix competition have proven that the matrix factorization algorithm achieves better performance than other recommendation algorithms when the rating data is scarce. However, the highly sparse rating matrix will cause the overfitting problem in matrix factorization. Although regularization can relieve the issue of overfitting to some extent, it is still a significant challenge to train an effective model for recommender systems when the data is highly sparse. Therefore, this paper proposes a co-SVD model to enrich the single data source and mitigate the overfitting problem in matrix factorization. The user preferences are enriched not only by rating data but also the tag data; subsequently, the relevance between tags and item features are explored. Furthermore, according to the assumption that user preferences will change with time, we optimize the preference and relevance by adding the temporal influence. Based on the MovieLens benchmark datasets, the experimental results indicate that the proposed co-SVD method is more effective than other baselines. Matrix co-factorization provides an effective method to the solve data sparsity problem with additional information. The method can be used to address this problem in various expert and intelligent systems such as recommendation advertisements, e-commerce sites, and social media platforms, all of which require a relatively large amount of input data from users.}

As the Web evolves into omnipresent utility, recommender systems penetrate more serious applications such as those in online scientific communities. In this paper, we investigate the task of recommendation in online scientific communities which exhibit two characteristics: 1) there exists very rich information about users and items; 2) The users in the scientific communities tend not to give explicit ratings to the resources, even though they have clear preference in their minds. To address the above two characteristics, we propose matrix factorization techniques to incorporate rich user and item information into recommendation with implicit feedback. Specifically, the user information matrix is decomposed into a shared subspace with the implicit feedback matrix, and so does the item information matrix. In other words, the subspaces between multiple related matrices are jointly learned by sharing information between the matrices. The experiments on the testbed from an online scientific community (i.e., Nanohub) show that the proposed method can effectively improve the recommendation performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Student grade prediction (SGP) is an important educational problem for designing personalized strategies of teaching and learning. Many studies adopt the technique of matrix factorization (MF). However, their methods often focus on the grade records regardless of the side information, such as backgrounds and relationships. To this end, in this paper, we propose a new MF method, called graph regularized robust matrix factorization (GRMF), based on the recent robust MF version. GRMF integrates two side graphs built on the side data of students and courses into the objective of robust low-rank MF. As a result, the learned features of students and courses can grasp more priors from educational situations to achieve higher grade prediction results. The resulting objective problem can be effectively optimized by the Majorization Minimization (MM) algorithm. In addition, GRMF not only can yield the specific features for the education domain but can also deal with the case of missing, noisy, and corruptive data. To verify our method, we test GRMF on two public data sets for rating prediction and image recovery. Finally, we apply GRMF to educational data from our university, which is composed of 1325 students and 832 courses. The extensive experimental results manifestly show that GRMF is robust to various data problem and achieves more effective features in comparison with other methods. Moreover, GRMF also delivers higher prediction accuracy than other methods on our educational data set. This technique can facilitate personalized teaching and learning in higher education.},

In the end, we propose CLRCMD, a contrastive learning framework that optimizes RCMD of sentence pairs, which enhances the quality of sentence similarity and their interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our learning framework outperforms other baselines on both STS and interpretable-STS benchmarks, indicating that it computes effective sentence similarity and also provides interpretation consistent with human judgement.",

ABSTRACT = {News impact analysis has become a common task conducted by finance researchers, which involves reading and selecting news articles based on themes and sentiments, pairing news events and relevant stocks, and measuring the impact of selected news on stock prices. To facilitate more efficient news selection, topic modeling can be applied to generate topics out of a large number of news documents. However, there is very limited existing literature comparing topic models in the context of finance-related news impact analysis. In this paper, we compare three state-of-the-art topic models, namely Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), Top2Vec, and BERTopic, in a defined scenario of news impact analysis on financial markets, where 38,240 news articles with an average length of 590 words are analyzed. A service-oriented framework for news impact analysis called &ldquo;News Impact Analysis&rdquo; (NIA) is advocated to leverage multiple topic models and provide an automated and seamless news impact analysis process for finance researchers. Experimental results have shown that BERTopic performed best in this scenario, with minimal data preprocessing, the highest coherence score, the best interpretability, and reasonable computing time. In addition, a finance researcher was able to conduct the entire news impact analysis process, which validated the feasibility and usability of the NIA framework.},

However, traditional indices which help measure financial stability such as quantile, leverage ratio and liquidity have instinctive shortcomings. For example, these digital indices are usually unavailable and one-sided. Therefore, finding a new approach to quantifying and visualizing financial stability is necessary and desirable. Different from digital data, textual data is more available and usually implies more abundant information and intuitional senses. Since textual data is not visualized, it is vital to find out what texts talk about. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is one of the most effective approaches to achieve above goal. In order to apply LDA to measure financial stability, China Financial Stability Report is selected to make an empirical analysis. The results are as follows. Firstly, it is reasonable that LDA model can be applied to analyze China Financial Stability Report. Secondly, dividing core terms of every topic into basic terms and particular terms, we can draw pictures of every embranchment in finance. And we can analyze topics rank of 5 years or in every single year, so that a designing matrix comes into being and we can study financial stability tendencies. At last, the macro-environment in finance can be depicted easily using word cloud.}

abstract = {Abstract A new method for automatic indexing and retrieval is described. The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (“semantic structure”) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. Initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising. © 1990 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

NLP has been employed in many applications, such as information retrieval, information processing and automated answer ranking. Semantic analysis focuses on understanding the meaning of text. Among other proposed approaches, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a widely used corpus-based approach that evaluates similarity of text based on the semantic relations among words. LSA has been applied successfully in diverse language systems for calculating the semantic similarity of texts. LSA ignores the structure of sentences, i.e., it suffers from a syntactic blindness problem. LSA fails to distinguish between sentences that contain semantically similar words but have opposite meanings. Disregarding sentence structure, LSA cannot differentiate between a sentence and a list of keywords. If the list and the sentence contain similar words, comparing them using LSA would lead to a high similarity score. In this paper, we propose xLSA, an extension of LSA that focuses on the syntactic structure of sentences to overcome the syntactic blindness problem of the original LSA approach. xLSA was tested on sentence pairs that contain similar words but have significantly different meaning. Our results showed that xLSA alleviates the syntactic blindness problem, providing more realistic semantic similarity scores.}

ABSTRACT = {This manuscript provides a comprehensive exploration of Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), highlighting its strengths, drawbacks, and challenges. The PLSA, originally a tool for information retrieval, provides a probabilistic sense for a table of co-occurrences as a mixture of multinomial distributions spanned over a latent class variable and adjusted with the expectation&ndash;maximization algorithm. The distributional assumptions and the iterative nature lead to a rigid model, dividing enthusiasts and detractors. Those drawbacks have led to several reformulations: the extension of the method to normal data distributions and a non-parametric formulation obtained with the help of Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) techniques. Furthermore, the combination of theoretical studies and programming techniques alleviates the computational problem, thus making the potential of the method explicit: its relation with the Singular value decomposition (SVD), which means that PLSA can be used to satisfactorily support other techniques, such as the construction of Fisher kernels, the probabilistic interpretation of Principal component analysis (PCA), Transfer learning (TL), and the training of neural networks, among others. We also present open questions as a practical and theoretical research window.},

TITLE={A Topic Modeling Comparison Between LDA, NMF, Top2Vec, and BERTopic to Demystify Twitter Posts},

ABSTRACT={The richness of social media data has opened a new avenue for social science research to gain insights into human behaviors and experiences. In particular, emerging data-driven approaches relying on topic models provide entirely new perspectives on interpreting social phenomena. However, the short, text-heavy, and unstructured nature of social media content often leads to methodological challenges in both data collection and analysis. In order to bridge the developing field of computational science and empirical social research, this study aims to evaluate the performance of four topic modeling techniques; namely latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), Top2Vec, and BERTopic. In view of the interplay between human relations and digital media, this research takes Twitter posts as the reference point and assesses the performance of different algorithms concerning their strengths and weaknesses in a social science context. Based on certain details during the analytical procedures and on quality issues, this research sheds light on the efficacy of using BERTopic and NMF to analyze Twitter data.}

abstract = {Learning topics from short texts has become a critical and fundamental task for understanding the widely-spread streaming social messages, e.g., tweets, snippets and questions/answers. Up to date, there are two distinctive topic learning schemes: generative probabilistic graphical models and geometrically linear algebra approaches, with LDA and NMF being the representative works, respectively. Since these two methods both could uncover the latent topics hidden in the unstructured short texts, some interesting doubts are coming to our minds that which one is better and why? Are there any other more effective extensions? In order to explore valuable insights between LDA and NMF based learning schemes, we comprehensively conduct a series of experiments into two parts. Specifically, the basic LDA and NMF are compared with different experimental settings on several public short text datasets in the first part which would exhibit that NMF tends to perform better than LDA; in the second part, we propose a novel model called “Knowledge-guided Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Better Short Text Topic Mining” (abbreviated as KGNMF), which leverages external knowledge as a semantic regulator with low-rank formalizations, yielding up a time-efficient algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on three representative corpora with currently typical short text topic models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed KGNMF. Overall, learning with NMF-based schemes is another effective manner in short text topic mining in addition to the popular LDA-based paradigms.}

Topic modeling algorithms including NMF-based ones do not require expensive and time-consuming manual annotations for domain terms, but only a corpus of domain documents. The topics emerge from the corpus documents without any supervision as sets of most probable words. This work is aimed to investigate how fully and precisely these most probable words from topics can reflect domain terminology. We run a series of experiments on the novel, qualitatively annotated dataset ACTER that was first used in the TermEval 2020 Shared Task. We compare five different NMF algorithms and four different NMF initializations when changing the number of topics extracted from documents and the number of most probable words extracted from topics in order to determine optimal combinations for best performance of term extraction. Finally, we compare the obtained optimal combinations of NMF with the competitive methods in TermEval 2020 and prove that our approach is second only to two much more sophisticated, domain-dependent supervised methods.}

Some users want topic models that highlight differences between, for example, authors, but others seek more subtle connections across authors. We introduce three metrics for identifying topics that are highly correlated with metadata, and demonstrate that this problem affects between 30 and 50{\%} of the topics in models trained on two real-world collections, regardless of the size of the model. We find that we can predict which words cause this phenomenon and that by selectively subsampling these words we dramatically reduce topic-metadata correlation, improve topic stability, and maintain or even improve model quality.",

In the latent semantic space derived by the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), each axis captures the base topic of a particular document cluster, and each document is represented as an additive combination of the base topics. The cluster membership of each document can be easily determined by finding the base topic (the axis) with which the document has the largest projection value. Our experimental evaluations show that the proposed document clustering method surpasses the latent semantic indexing and the spectral clustering methods not only in the easy and reliable derivation of document clustering results, but also in document clustering accuracies.},

abstract="Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) approximates a nonnegative matrix by the product of two low-rank nonnegative matrices. Since it gives semantically meaningful result that is easily interpretable in clustering applications, NMF has been widely used as a clustering method especially for document data, and as a topic modeling method.We describe several fundamental facts of NMF and introduce its optimization framework called block coordinate descent. In the context of clustering, our framework provides a flexible way to extend NMF such as the sparse NMF and the weakly-supervised NMF. The former provides succinct representations for better interpretations while the latter flexibly incorporate extra information and user feedback in NMF, which effectively works as the basis for the visual analytic topic modeling system that we present.Using real-world text data sets, we present quantitative experimental results showing the superiority of our framework from the following aspects: fast convergence, high clustering accuracy, sparse representation, consistent output, and user interactivity. In addition, we present a visual analytic system called UTOPIAN (User-driven Topic modeling based on Interactive NMF) and show several usage scenarios.Overall, our book chapter cover the broad spectrum of NMF in the context of clustering and topic modeling, from fundamental algorithmic behaviors to practical visual analytics systems.",

ABSTRACT={With the growth of online social network platforms and applications, large amounts of textual user-generated content are created daily in the form of comments, reviews, and short-text messages. As a result, users often find it challenging to discover useful information or more on the topic being discussed from such content. Machine learning and natural language processing algorithms are used to analyze the massive amount of textual social media data available online, including topic modeling techniques that have gained popularity in recent years. This paper investigates the topic modeling subject and its common application areas, methods, and tools. Also, we examine and compare five frequently used topic modeling methods, as applied to short textual social data, to show their benefits practically in detecting important topics. These methods are latent semantic analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation, non-negative matrix factorization, random projection, and principal component analysis. Two textual datasets were selected to evaluate the performance of included topic modeling methods based on the topic quality and some standard statistical evaluation metrics, like recall, precision, F-score, and topic coherence. As a result, latent Dirichlet allocation and non-negative matrix factorization methods delivered more meaningful extracted topics and obtained good results. The paper sheds light on some common topic modeling methods in a short-text context and provides direction for researchers who seek to apply these methods.}

In this paper, text mining is used to identify sustainability trends and practices in the process industries. Four main sectors of the industry are studied: oil/petrochemicals, bulk/specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and consumer products. Our study reveals that the top sustainability focuses of the four sectors are very similar: health and safety, human rights, reducing GHG, conserving energy/energy efficiency, and community investment. Sector-specific sustainability issues have also been identified, for example oil spill prevention in the oil/petrochemicals sector and access to medicine in the pharmaceuticals sector. Environment is identified to be the predominant sustainability aspect in the process industries. The text mining methodology, results, and findings are detailed in the paper.}

In addition, Leximancer displays the results of the analyses visually, thus providing a view of the conceptual and thematic structure of the text, and enabling a researcher to quantify and display the text structure. The results of our analyses demonstrate three common themes (Business, Employees and Energy/Environment) observable across eight of the nine industries in our sample. In addition, we observed significant differences in the relative emphasis for the three common themes across industries. We believe a deeper understanding of the themes that motivate firms' sustainability efforts can enhance future research that explores relationships between organizational sustainability efforts and organizational performance.},

Based on disclosure topics from Global Reporting Initiative and a scoring system, an evaluation framework was developed in order to assess the quality of information published in sustainability reports with respect to each UN\_SDG. An empirical analysis was performed in a sample of sustainability reports in order to examine the structure and the applicability of the proposed methodological framework. The outcomes of the empirical analysis reflect some implications for future research on the UN\_SDG reporting practices.},

The analysis is used to support either the signalling hypothesis or the opportunistic behavior hypothesis in corporate reporting that form a background for decision support systems using sentiment analysis. The research procedure involved the content analysis of a sample of EU companies’ annual reports, the sentiment analysis of CSR disclosures of the reports, and the multivariate regression. The research sample consists of 102 EU companies required to prepare a non-financial statement, but only those companies that are just-above-the-threshold. The results show that the sentiment of CSR disclosures is correlated with the company size, although only in the case of positive tone the correlation is positive. The larger companies tend to avoid negative words. The signaling hypothesis is confirmed only in the case of a positive sentiment: the extent of positive tone correlates positively with financial performance. This result is useful in further research on the determinants of a CSR disclosure sentiment, and in decision support systems that utilize a sentiment analysis of CSR reports.}
